    "<font size=+3>&#9998;</font> The relationship between body mass and bill depth changed drastically when split by species because there appears to be a direct relationship between bill depth and body mass for each individual species, but one species of penguin tends to have a higher body mass and a slightly smaller bill depth than the other two species. The data on Adelie penguins is clustered around an area of higher body mass and lower bill depth than the Chinstrap and Gentoo species. The data for Chinstrap and Gentoo species are generally clustered around the same average bill depth and body mass. This means that the overall data has clusters in two places, one of which is above and to the left of the other on a scatterplot. Therefore, the overall line of best fit for the entire penguin dataset has a negative slope, even though each species' line of best fit has a positive slope."
