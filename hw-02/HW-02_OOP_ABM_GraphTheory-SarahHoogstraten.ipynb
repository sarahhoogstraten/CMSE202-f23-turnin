    "To advance the adoption of electric vehicles around the country, there needs to be a concerted effort to install the infrastructure of electric car charging stations.  For this part of the assignment, you're going to implement an Agent Based Model of the installation of electric charging stations in a country.  The basic rules of this model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The country will be modeled as a square grid.\n",
    "2. Installation teams try to install a charging station at each location in the grid; Once a charging station is installed it lasts forever.\n",
    "3. At every increment of time, an installation team visits one random location in the grid and has a chance of succeeding at installing a station. Each install team has their own probability of success based on the skills+experience of the team. \n",
    "4. At each location in grid, sometimes the install teams fails to install a charging station because of various forces outside the control of the team such as inability to secure permits, necessary contracts, or local supplies.  Because of these forces outside the control of the team, each location in the grid has its own base probability of receiving a charging station. \n",
    "5. If a team fails to install a charging station at a location, it still makes a positive impact by improving the base probability of that location receiving a charging station in the future. \n",
    "6. Each time step in the model represents one month.\n"
